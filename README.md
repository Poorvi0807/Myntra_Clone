**In the construct week.**

This is our first collaborative project from the Masai school, and we got only 1 week to complete it, 
so it was a challenging journey for us. we faced a lot of challenges because we don’t work before on any collaborative project and 
we have to complete it on time, so we first decide to study our website and then divide our work. we learned a lot while working together, 
we failed a lot of times but we never give up, we used to help each other solve the problems of our project, and in the last, we finally made our project successfully.

**Description of Project.**
